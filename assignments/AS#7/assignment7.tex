% Problem 1:

\section{Which of the following graphs contain and Euler path? Which contain and Euler circuit? Show your work (including the graph).}
\subsection{$K_4$}
\hspace{1cm}\textit{$K_4$ does not contain any Euler paths and thus does not contain any Euler circuits. This is because all of the points in the graph have a degree of $3$. An Euler path will only occur in a graph with at most $2$ vertices of odd degree.}
\subsection{$K_5$}

    \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.5]
        \node[draw, circle, fill=gray!50] (node1) at (-2,4) {1};  
        \node[draw, circle, fill=gray!50] (node2) at (-6,2) {2};
        \node[draw, circle, fill=gray!50] (node3) at (-5,-2) {3};
        \node[draw, circle, fill=gray!50] (node4) at (1,-2) {4};
        \node[draw, circle, fill=gray!50] (node5) at (2,2) {5};
        
        \draw[->] (node1) -- (node3);
        \draw[->] (node3) -- (node5);
        \draw[->] (node5) -- (node2);
        \draw[->] (node2) -- (node4);
        \draw[->] (node4) -- (node1);
        \draw[->] (node1) -- (node2);
        \draw[->] (node2) -- (node3);
        \draw[->] (node3) -- (node4);
        \draw[->] (node4) -- (node5);
        \draw[->] (node5) -- (node1);
    \end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}
\hspace{1cm}\textit{$K_5$ contains an Euler circuit!}
\subsection{$K_{5,7}$}
\hspace{1cm}\textit{$K_{5,7}$ does not contain an Euler path or circuit because all $12$ of the vertices all have odd degrees. This is because $K_{5,7}$ represents a bipartite graph. In the first set, each vertex has $7$ degrees, and in the second set, each vertex has $5$ degrees. This is far beyond the $2$ odd degree vertex limit.}
\clearpage
\subsection{$K_{2,7}$}
\hspace{1cm}\textit{Since $K_{2,7}$ has $2$ vertices with odd degrees, the graph should have an Euler path, but not an Euler circuit. This can be observed inthe below graph where the path can begin on vertex $A$ and end on vertex $B$.}

        \node[draw, circle, fill=gray!50] (node1) at (0,0) {1};  
        \node[draw, circle, fill=gray!50] (node2) at (1,0) {2};
        \node[draw, circle, fill=gray!50] (node3) at (2,0) {3};
        \node[draw, circle, fill=gray!50] (node4) at (3,0) {4};
        \node[draw, circle, fill=gray!50] (node5) at (4,0) {5};
        \node[draw, circle, fill=gray!50] (node6) at (5,0) {6};
        \node[draw, circle, fill=gray!50] (node7) at (6,0) {7};
        \node[draw, circle, fill=gray!50] (nodeA) at (2,1.5) {A};
        \node[draw, circle, fill=gray!50] (nodeB) at (4,1.5) {B};
        
        \draw[->] (nodeA) -- (node1);
        \draw[->] (node1) -- (nodeB);
        \draw[->] (nodeB) -- (node2);
        \draw[->] (node2) -- (nodeA);
        \draw[->] (nodeA) -- (node3);
        \draw[->] (node3) -- (nodeB);

        \draw[->] (node6) -- (nodeA);

        \draw[->] (node7) -- (nodeB);
    \end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}
\subsection{$C_7$}
\hspace{1cm}\textit{$C_7$ is cycle graph and therefore contains an Euler circuit. This makes sense because it is a complete graph and every vertex has a degree of $2$.}
\subsection{$P_7$}
\hspace{1cm}\textit{$P_7$ is a graph in which the degrees are $(1,2,2,2,2,2,1)$. Thus, the graph will not have an Euler circuit, but has an euler path. This can be observed in the graph below.}

        \node[draw, circle, fill=gray!50] (node3) at (2,0) {3};
        \node[draw, circle, fill=gray!50] (node4) at (3,1) {4};
        \node[draw, circle, fill=gray!50] (node5) at (4,0) {5};

        \draw[->] (node1) -- (node2);
        \draw[->] (node2) -- (node3);
        \draw[->] (node3) -- (node4);
        \draw[->] (node4) -- (node5);
        \draw[->] (node5) -- (node6);
