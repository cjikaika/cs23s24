\section{Which of the following graphs contain and Euler path? Which contain and Euler circuit? Show your work (including the graph).}
\subsection{$K_4$}
\hspace{1cm}\textit{$K_4$ does not contain any Euler paths and thus does not contain any Euler circuits. This is because all of the points in the graph have a degree of $3$. An Euler path will only occur in a graph with at most $2$ vertices of odd degree.}
\subsection{$K_5$}

        \node[draw, circle, fill=gray!50] (node4) at (1,-2) {4};

        \draw[->] (node5) -- (node1);
    \end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}
\hspace{1cm}\textit{$K_5$ contains an Euler circuit!}
\subsection{$K_{5,7}$}
\hspace{1cm}\textit{$K_{5,7}$ does not contain an Euler path or circuit because all $12$ of the vertices all have odd degrees. This is because $K_{5,7}$ represents a bipartite graph. In the first set, each vertex has $7$ degrees, and in the second set, each vertex has $5$ degrees. This is far beyond the $2$ odd degree vertex limit.}
\clearpage
\subsection{$K_{2,7}$}
\hspace{1cm}\textit{Since $K_{2,7}$ has $2$ vertices with odd degrees, the graph should have an Euler path, but not an Euler circuit. This can be observed inthe below graph where the path can begin on vertex $A$ and end on vertex $B$.}

\subsection{$C_7$}
\hspace{1cm}\textit{$C_7$ is cycle graph and therefore contains an Euler circuit. This makes sense because it is a complete graph and every vertex has a degree of $2$.}
\subsection{$P_7$}
\hspace{1cm}\textit{$P_7$ is a graph in which the degrees are $(1,2,2,2,2,2,1)$. Thus, the graph will not have an Euler circuit, but has an euler path. This can be observed in the graph below.}

\subsection{Find a Hamilton path. Can this path be extended to a Hamilton cycle?}
\hspace{1cm}\textit{I cannot find a hamilton path for this graph. Every path seems to dead end in a two way split. If I could find a path, it could not be extended to a cycle, as the graph appears to be bipartite.}

\subsection{Use your answer in part (b) to prove that the graph has no Hamilton cycle.}
\hspace{1cm}\textit{Since the graph is bipartite, there can only be a Hamilton cycle if the number of vertices in both parts are equal. That is not the case in this graph, therefore, there is no Hamilton cycle.}
\subsection{Suppose you have a bipartite graph $G$ in which one part has at least two more vertices than the other. Prove that $G$ does not have a Hamilton path.}
\hspace{1cm}\textit{A Hamilton path is a bipartite graph will alternate between vertices in the opposing parts. Since the path can only visit each vertex once, there will always be at least $1$ vertex that is impossible to visit.}
