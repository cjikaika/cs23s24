% Problem 1:
\section{Is $(1, 2, 3, 4) = (1, 2, 4, 3)$?}
\hspace{1cm}\textbf{No.}\textit{ Unlike sets, the order of elements in a tuple matters.}

% Problem 2
\section{Which of the following are equivalent: \\
    $\{a, b, c\}, \{\{a, b\}, c\}, (a, b, c), (a, (b, c)), (b, c, a),
    \\ \{\{a, b, c\}\}, \{b, c, a\}, \{\}, \{\{\}\}$}
\hspace{1cm}\textbf{$\{a, b, c\}$ is equivalent to $\{b, c, a\}$.}\textit{
    All other tuples and sets are inequivalent due to differences in strcture
    or order of elements.}

% Problem 3:

\section{Let $A = \{2, 3, 4\}$ and $B = \{6, 8, 10\}$ and define
    a relation $R$ from $A$ to $B$ as follows:
    For every $(x, y) \in A \times B$, $(x, y) \in R$ means that
    $\frac{y}{x}$ is an integer.}
\subsection{Is $4R6$? Is $4R8$? Is $(3,8) \in R$? Is $(2,10) \in R$?}
\hspace{1cm}\textit{$\frac{6}{4} = 1.5$ is not an integer.}\textbf{ Therefore,
    $4R6$ is not true.}\textit{ $\frac{8}{4} = 2$ is an integer.}\textbf{ Therefore,
    $4R8$ is true.}\textit{ $\frac{8}{3}$ is not an integer.}\textbf{ Therefore,
    $(3,8) \in R$ is not true.}\textit{ $\frac{10}{2} = 5$ is an integer.}
    \textbf{ Therefore, $(2,10) \in R$ is true.}
\subsection{Write $R$ as a set of ordered pairs.}
\hspace{1cm}\textit{$R = \{(2,6),(2,8),(2,10),(3,6),(4,8)\}$.}
\subsection{Write the domain and co-domain of $R$.}
\hspace{1cm}\textit{The domain of $R$ is $A$ and the co-domain is $B$.}
\subsection{Draw an arrow diagram for $R$.}

\section{Two faces of a six sided dice are painted red, two are painted green

\subsection{Consider the event where all three rolls produce a different color.
    One outcome in the event is RGB. List all outcomes in the event and its probability.}
\hspace{1cm}\textbf{RGB, GRB, GBR, BGR, RBG, BRG. $\frac{6}{27}$ gives us a $22.2\%$ probability.}

% Problem 6:

\section{You have two hats. The first hat contains 2 orange marbles and 7 red marbles;
    the second hat contains 4 orange marbles and 3 red marbles. Bob selects a marble
    by first picking one of the two hats at random. He then selects one of the marbles in this hat
    at random. If Bob has selected a red marble, what is the probability that he selected a
    marble from the first hat?}
\hspace{1cm}\textit{To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' Theorem:}
\begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{c|c|c}
        Quantity & Meaning & Value \\
        \hline
        $Pr(H_1)$ & First hat is picked & $1/2$ \\
        $Pr(H_2)$ & Second hat is picked & $1/2$ \\
        \hline
        $Pr(R|H_1)$ & Red marble in first hat & $7/9$ \\
        $Pr(R|H_2)$ & Red marble in second hat & $3/7$ \\
        $Pr(O|H_1)$ & Orange marble in first hat & $2/9$ \\
        $Pr(O|H_2)$ & Orange marble in second hat & $4/7$ \\
    \end{tabular} \\
    \vspace{0.25cm}
    $Pr(H_1|R) = \frac{Pr(R|H_1)\cdot Pr(H_1)}{Pr(R)}$ \\
    \vspace{0.25cm}
    \textit{Solve for $Pr(R)$ using the total probability theorem:} \\
    \vspace{0.25cm}
    $Pr(R) = Pr(R|H_1)\cdot Pr(H_1) + Pr(R|H_2)\cdot Pr(H_2)$ \\
    \vspace{0.25cm}
    $ = \frac{7}{9}\cdot \frac{1}{2} + \frac{3}{7}\cdot \frac{1}{2} = 
    \frac{7}{18} + \frac{3}{14} = \frac{38}{63}$ \\
    \vspace{0.25cm}
    \textit{Finish by plugging in known values:} \\
    \vspace{0.25cm}
    $ Pr(H_1|R) = \frac{(7/9)(1/2)}{(38/63)} = 64.47\%$ \\

% Problem 7:

\section{Suppose that the words ``Act now" occur in 250 out of 2500 messages known to be spam
    and in 5 of 1000 messages known not to be spam. Estimate the probability that an
    incoming message containing the words ``Act now" is spam, assuming that it is equally
    likely that an incoming message is spam or not spam. If our threshold for rejecting
    a message as spam is 0.9, will we reject this incoming message?}
